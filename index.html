                <p>
                    Hello! I‚Äôm currently a full-time software developer working at Eagle Creek Software where we work on
                    various IT projects such as application development. At Eagle Creek, I‚Äôve gained experience working
                    in an agile, team-focused environment while improving my skills developed from schooling. I
                    graduated from the University of South Dakota with a B.S in Computer Science. I worked at Great West
                    Casualty Company as a software developer intern working on various tasks such as developing web
                    applications, databases/APIs, and converting an older software to a newer system. (More details in
                    resume).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also work on personal projects when I have time. My most recent is an application that returns
                    images from the web when given a list of words, for the image retrieval I used Unsplash's API. The
                    others are game ideas/experiments I worked on with a friend utilizing Unity and wrote in C#. We have
                    also participated in a few game jams and hope to do more in the future.
